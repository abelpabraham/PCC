# Printing Cost Calculator

## 1. Project Overview

This project involves the development of a web-based **Printing Cost Calculator** using **Python**, **Django**, and **PostgreSQL**. The system is designed to support different user roles and allow for flexible product configurations for estimating printing costs.

The main features of the system include:

- User authentication and role-based access control.
- Dynamic product configurations for different types of print jobs.
- Automatic calculation of printing costs based on product specifications.
- Integration with a PostgreSQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval.

## 2. Features

- **Role-based Access Control:** Admins, Users, and Guests can access the system with different permissions.
- **Product Configurations:** Admins can add, edit, and delete print product types, including specifications like paper size, quality options, and quantity.
- **Cost Estimation:** The system dynamically calculates the printing cost based on the selected product configurations.
- **Reports and Analysis:** Generate reports for printing cost estimations and analyze historical data for better decision-making.

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Django (Framework)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (can be extended with frameworks like Bootstrap or React)
- **Deployment:** Can be deployed on any Django-compatible hosting service or cloud platform like Heroku.
